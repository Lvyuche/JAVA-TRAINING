Eager Initialization:  The instance is created when the class is loaded, 
which avoids the need for synchronization but may result in the instance being created even if it's never used
public class Singleton {
    
    private static final Singleton instance = new Singleton();
    
    private Singleton() {}
    
    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        return instance;
    }
}
